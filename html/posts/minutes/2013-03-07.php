    Hey guys,
    <br /><br />
    In case you missed the meeting here’s some of what we talked about:
    <ul>
      <li>We will be showing The Last Mountain in the Student Center forum some Thursday in the weeks to come (stay tuned!)</li>
      <li>We will start giving receipts for dues given from new members</li>
      <li>We’re looking for help with hosting a soldering workshop.  We’re looking at having a table set up in the Student Center to advertise and hold sign ups.  If you’re looking into helping out more (VOLUNTEER HOURS) stay tuned for an email asking for help to man the booth.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
