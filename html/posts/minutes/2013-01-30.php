    Hey all,
    <br /><br />
    A few notes from this week’s meeting:
    <br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        We are going to start preparing for this semester’s induction pretty soon. Tynan will 
        set up two interest meetings for the inductees in the near future, and it would be nice 
        to have some members come along to help share some HKN experiences. Look out for those 
        meeting invites.
      </li>
      <li>
        We won’t be showing our movies during Engineer’s Week, but hopefully soon after. We’re 
        looking for someone to volunteer to take control of that.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tynan will send out a signup sheet so that we can sign up for our intern/coop presentations 
        that we will present to the other members during each meeting.
      </li>
      <li>
        We are still looking for ideas for the scavenger hunt. Preferably a problem involving 
        power, systems and signals, or controls would be preferred as we pretty much have the 
        other areas covered. The deadline for these is Sunday, so if you’re interested in helping, 
        please do so soon. For the presentation, we are planning on having demos that may include 
        the electric snowmobile, Brad’s stereo backpack, Lief’s spot welder, and projects that we 
        have done in previous classes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Enjoy the rest of your week!
