    Hey guys,
    <br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        This is a reminder about the HKN induction info sessions on Tuesday 2/12 and Wednesday 2/20 at 4PM and 
        5PM respectively. Both are in Rowley Labs 142. Please try to attend at least one of these to share 
        information with the incoming students.
      </li>
      <li>
        We’re still working on questions for the Engineer week scavenger hunt. We’re trying to create a question 
        that involves Software Engineering.
      </li>
      <li>
        On Thursday 2/21 during Engineer Week, a few of us will give brief presentations to the students 
        about our academic experiences as well as internship experiences. This will take place in 
        the EE lab.

        Take a look at these options that Tynan is considering for the soldering workshop so that you can 
        provide your input. http://www.hobbyengineering.com/CatEKGAME.html. http://adafruit.com/products/89.

        Teresa is in charge of booking the Student Center Forum to play The Last Mountain, most likely on Thursday, February 28.
