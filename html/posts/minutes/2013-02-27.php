    Hey guys,
    <br /><br />
    Here are a few notes from todayâ€™s meeting:
    <ul>
      <li>We will be holding inductions for new members pretty soon. This will probably happen shortly after spring break.</li>
      <li>After the induction, we will go to dinner and invite a TA and Professor that have played an important role in your education. Teresa recently emailed you about this.</li>
      <li>We are working on creating a directory of alumni that we can contact, mostly for obtaining job information.</li>
      <li>Tynan is working on getting funding to buy the Game of Life kit for the upcoming soldering workshop.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    All for now. Have a great week.
    <br /><br />
    - Andrew
