    Hey guys,
    <br /><br />
    Here are some notes from today’s meeting, in case you weren’t able to attend.
    <br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Meetings will probably be Thursdays from 4-5PM and Wednesdays from 5-6PM, alternating each week. 
        Meeting invites to follow soon.

        Brad has a website built, but it was designed using a program that can’t be supported by the 
        Clarkson server. When it is up and running, any member should be able to upload information to 
        the site. We’re hoping to have that ready pretty soon.

        Alex needs help with Engineer’s week. He needs your ideas on engineering problems to be used in 
        the scavenger hunt. These should be fairly simple electrical engineering problems that a freshman 
        would be able to solve. We also plan on having a short presentation where a few of us will talk 
        about our specific concentrations. This is to teach students with undeclared majors how awesome 
        it is to be an EE or a CompE or maybe even a SoftE. We’re trying to get some demonstrations set 
        up as well, so be sure to share your ideas with Alex! I’m sure he’ll have more information at 
        the next meeting, as he is still drawing up the overall process. This event will be happening 
        on Thursday, 2/21.

        Professor Ortmeyer informed us of the Tektronix competition. Tynan will send out link soon. You 
        just have to fill out a few bits of information about yourself. This counts as a vote. Then you 
        need to post this to Facebook or Twitter where your friends can do the same. The school that gets 
        the most votes can win new equipment for their lab! Hopefully this will end all complaints about 
        the quality of the equipment in the lab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each meeting, Tynan will pitch for a project that we can do until he finds something we can all 
        agree on.
      </li>
      <li>
        We will try to play the Last Mountain or Who Killed the Electric Car in student center forum 
        during Engineering week in February.

        We’re considering a new kit for the soldering workshop as the current one seems like a lot of 
        work for someone learning to solder. There are a few more ideas that are a bit cheaper and easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tynan will send out a link so that we can sign up for intern/coop presentations as we’re hoping 
        to bring that back this semester. We will try to get some professors to present as well.
      </li>
